# sieve-of-eratosthenes-OpenMP

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classical algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. This project implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes in 2 different ways 
- Going the sequential approach
- Using OpenMP for parallel execution

Using OpenMP, I got it to run approximately 1.5x - 1.7x faster than the sequential approach
